# cheshire-cat-adapters

This project is a collection of alternative ways to interface [Cheshire Cat](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat) than the default WebSocket available at **ws://localhost:1865/ws**. It is the refactoring of some code from the [siri-cheshire-cat](https://github.com/xdatap1/siri-cheshire-cat) and [cheshire-cat-web-bridge](https://github.com/xdatap1/cheshire-cat-web-bridge) Proof of Concepts. Each adapter is more clean and robust, so this repository is to be considered the preferable version, whils the other two are to be considered deprecated.

### Adapters

* [Command Line Adapter](https://github.com/xdatap1/cheshire-cat-adapters/tree/main/command-line)
* [Rest API Adapter](https://github.com/xdatap1/cheshire-cat-adapters/tree/main/rest-api)
* [Apple's Siri Adapter](https://github.com/xdatap1/cheshire-cat-adapters/tree/main/siri)
 
### Final Notes
This is just a Prof of Concept to demonstrate different way to interface Cheshire Cat, have fun, and learn new stuff. To get a little help, I must confess that I used ChatGPT. So the code might be redundant and not very elegant. Feel free to fork and adapt it as you prefer. It's not going to be maintained in any way.
